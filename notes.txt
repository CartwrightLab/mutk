# Ideas

## version.cmake improvements

- Define a function/macro that makes it easier to call on different projects with different outputs: configure_ver
- Use CONFVER_ or VERNUM_ or VN_ or VNDB_ or SEMVER_ as prefix
- Replace a user-derived .in file with an internal format.
- Then have users use that file to create their own formats. This allows one version+git database to be used by multiple files
- Read https://semver.org/
- Set _PATCH to zero instead of undefined on a prerelease
- Allow prerelease tag to be modified
- Add tag information to semver db.
